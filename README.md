# BikeSharing Analysis
## Overview
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. In this analysis we show how the bike-sharing program is a potential benefit.

## Results
- We have 2,344,224 records of the bike sharing program in New York, this is 1/4 of the population.
- Male riders make up a majority of riders

## Summary
With this analysis we can evidence how mmales bikeshare a lot more than female, this gives us a huge opportunity to market towards the male community and encourage females to use or service. Having 1/4 of the NY population bikesharing shows us how this business can be scalable in different locations. I would suggest two more visualizations to perform analysis, the first would be an age range that would allow us to cluster the bike users; the second one would be an occupation visualization that would help us predict the reason why people use our service, is it for health purposes or is it mostly for transportation ease?
